# zencrypt

## about project
<b>zencrypt</b> is an amateur project that aims to collect all kinds of information about various
encryption and hashing algorithms in one place.

## aims project
- Collect detailed information about encryption and hashing algorithms, such as the structure of the algorithms, a description of the operation of each element and its purpose in the algorithm, a mathematical description of the algorithm, its resistance to various types of cryptanalysis, comparison with other algorithms, etc.
- Collect software implementations in C of encryption and hashing algorithms with comments and code descriptions (including super-optimized implementations that can be found in openssl or VeraCrypt, for example)
- Perhaps collect a hardware implementation
